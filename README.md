AgeDB
=====
AgeDB consists of two parts: The first is a web.py-based RESTful API which can be accessed by any client. The second is a javascript-based reference client.

Only the first part is currently available, though still incomplete

TODO
----
* Implement sequence prefix remapping for initial age upload
* Implement a form for maintainers to mark ages as verified/malicious
* Implement POST to ages to update information
